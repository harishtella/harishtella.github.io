title: Usability evaluation of data.census.gov
---

In a team of 5, I worked with the U.S. Census to perform an extensive usability evaluation of their new user-centered data platform, data.census.gov.

The first half of our project involved performing a thorough expert review. See this document for more information on the context and goals of this project along with the findings of our expert review. [expert review](https://harishtella.github.io/documents/750-expert-review.pdf). 

The second half of this project involved recruiting participants and
performing usability tests. See this document to understand our process
and what we discovered. [usability testing](https://harishtella.github.io/documents/750-usability-test.pdf).
