title: Usability testing of data.census.gov
---

I am part of a 5-person team that will be working with the Census Bureau to test the usability of their new user-centered data platform.

This project is currently underway. We have performed an extensive expert review. You can see our findings [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17spNOpu0PShCmNiy7BvR08uTIitebHFuDxd0CdyAsms/edit?usp=sharing). Usability testing is coming up next. Stay tuned for updates. For now, you can check out [data.census.gov](http://data.census.gov).
