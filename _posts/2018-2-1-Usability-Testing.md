I worked in a team of 5 and collaborated with the U.S. Census to perform an extensive usability evaluation of their new user-centered data platform, data.census.gov.

The first half of our project involved performing a thorough expert review of the system. See this document for more information on the context and goals of this project along with our expert review findings.

The second half of this project involved recruiting participants and
performing usability testing. See the below document to understand the process
behind how we did this and our final findings and recommendations
