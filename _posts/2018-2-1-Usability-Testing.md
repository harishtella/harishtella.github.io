I worked in a team of 5 and collaborated with the U.S. Census to perform an extensive usability evaluation of their new user-centered data platform, data.census.gov.

The first half of our project involved performing a thorough expert review. See this document for more information on the context and goals of this project along with our findings.

The second half of this project involved recruiting participants and
performing usability testing. See this document to understand our process
and what we discovered.
