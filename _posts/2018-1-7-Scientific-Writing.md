title: The nature and limits of basic visual perception

I wrote a scientific literature review of the biological aspects of human visual perception and applied this knowledge to a design critique of the Boss GT-3 guitar effects processor.

Here are some brief excerpts from the paper.

>_Our path towards understanding how the human visual system processes stimuli begins with signal detection theory. It provides a framework of perception that is probabilistic (Wickens, Hollands, Banbury, & Parasuraman, 2013). A particular stimulus is competing for attention with all other stimuli. Signal detection theory frames this as signal versus noise. The probability that a particular signal will be detected depends on its strength relative to the background noise–the greater the strength, the greater the likelihood of detection._

>_In the visual design arena, our signals are particular visual features that we want to arrive at the user’s attention, and noise is either other unrelated visual stimuli or stimuli that may be mistaken as our feature (McNicol, 1972). With an understanding of the visual system, one can modulate the signal strength of visual stimuli and thereby increase the likelihood that the user detects the desired features (Ware, 2013)._
