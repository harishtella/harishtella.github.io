title: The prospective grad student experience
---

I designed and carried out a user research study for Bentley University
that sought to improve the experience of prospective students by
examining analogous experiences.

Here are some brief excerpts from the report.

>We were commissioned to get a deeper understanding of Bentley Universityâ€™s prospective graduate student experience. Our client wanted insights into what went on between the points when a prospect reaches out to the university and when a prospect submits their final application. This window of time presents a number of unknowns. One of which is how does the prospect expect this engagement to progress? After considering many others questions posed by our client, we decided that this question and related questions would be the most fruitful avenue of research.

>Overall, we found three personas that span the range of behaviors and attitudes we found among our participants. The most important quality that was derived from these differences was the amount, type, and timing of support each persona preferred. This valuable insight could allow Bentley to more effectively allocate precious recruiting resources to its prospects.
