title: 3 great prototypes 
---

As part of a prototyping course, I developed three different prototypes in
three largely different domains and with three largely different project
dynamics.

The first prototype is an personal health-record app with the intention
of streamlining the patient experience. This was developed in a team of three, and it mainly served as a practice ground for the concepts learned in class. See the document below for the full story along with access to a clickable prototype.

The second prototype was collaboration between a team of two prototyping
students and a team of three marketing students. We worked together to
develop a concept that met a particular market need in schools. In this case, it
was a watch-based homework tracker that would allow students and school
administrators to assess the demands placed on students. Click below

<br/>

The last prototype is an effort to create an self-guided way of
collecting stories involving technologies of the past. This was an
individual project, and it embodies what I believe is an important
need-remembering and capturing what technology takes away not just what
it gives us. Click the below link for all the details.
