title: The demise of casual watching

I wrote a paper that introduces the term casual viewing and
explains how modern video-on-demand services, like Netflix, are leaving
out an important user need by not designing with this ability in mind.

_The above is a chart of need states fulfilled by television watching._

Here are some excerpts from the paper. 

>_The television industry has been undergoing a series of dramatic transformations over the last 30 years. These transformations have granted viewers increased amounts of freedom over what to watch and when to watch it (Jenner, 2016). This increased freedom in turn has brought changes in viewer behavior and changes in the nature of programming. This paper will show that the combined effect of these changes, embodied in the Netflix experience, is leaving out casual viewing._

>_Casual viewing is a term for television viewing experiences where
context takes priority over content. These experiences allow viewers to
pursue important needs such as mood-alteration and familiarity seeking.
An understanding of how to serve casual viewing in the modern
video-on-demand landscape has not yet been established. Such an
understanding would provide a major competitive advantage to
video-on-demand companies. This paper hopes to provide that
understanding and a possible vision for the future._
