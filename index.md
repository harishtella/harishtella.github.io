title: About Me
---

Hi, I am a human factors and user experience grad student at Bentley University. I have a prior degree in computer science, and before returning to school, I used my software development skills to contribute to projects in a variety of domains including bioinformatics, cloud infrastructure, and web applications. Later, I even taught people how to program through an intensive course in NYC.

Now as a grad student, I am focused on using user-centered design
principles to help create impactful and valuable experiences for others. I am particularly interested in experiences based in virtual reality along with experiences involving expert users and learners.
